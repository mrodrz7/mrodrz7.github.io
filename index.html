          <p>
            I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, raised in Somerville, MA and of <i>Latino</i> descent. 
            Before becoming an Engineer, I had a background in Quality Assurance as a QA Engineer and 
            outside of that world I have about 8 years of experience in Customer Service and Retail. My 
            favorite technologies to use are <strong>Vue.js</strong> and <strong>React.js</strong> for client side, 
            and <strong>Ruby on Rails for the back-end.</strong> I've built a few projects independently and with
            colleagues at General Assembly, as well as simple websites and blogs both on my own and with guidance 
            of <a href="codeacademy.com" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I'm an alumni of Year Up Greater Boston, where I graduated in the Quality Assurance program and
            of General Assembly where I attended the Software Engineering Immersive. My favorite part about that
            two year journey into Software Development were all the professional relationships I established, 
            great friendships I made, and abolishing my fear of networking! Now my mission is to start a lifelong
            career as a Software Engineer and continue to learn whenever I can.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Outside of programming, my hobbies include playing soccer with my friends, spending time with loved 
            ones, FIFA on the PS4, and trying to be the best dad to my little girl!
